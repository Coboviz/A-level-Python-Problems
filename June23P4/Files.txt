A procedure CreateFiles() will take two parameters: 
• a string representing a file name 
• an integer representing the number of files to be created.

The procedure will create the number of text files specified

 Each file is given a different name.  Each file name is formed by 
 concatenating the file name with a suffix based on the file number. 
 The suffix is always three characters.

  For example, the call CreateFiles("TestData", 3) 
  would result in the creation of the three files, 
  TestData.001, TestData.002 and TestData.003.

   Each file will contain a single line. For example, file TestData.002 would contain the string:    
   This is File TestData.002  Write pseudocode for CreateFiles().

 Assume both parameters are valid and that the integer value is between 1 and 999, inclusive.
