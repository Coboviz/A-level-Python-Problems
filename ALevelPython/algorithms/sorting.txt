Problem:

User inputs a number n - which represents a number of elements in the array.
Afterwards user inputs the elements of this array.
Your task is to sort this array into an ascending order (prev < next). Suppose
that all elements are different

DECLARE n, i, j, Temp : INTEGER
DECLARE List : ARRAY[1:1000] OF INTEGER
INPUT n
FOR i <- 1 TO n
    INPUT List[i]
NEXT i

FOR i <- 1 TO n
    FOR j <- 1 to n-1
        IF List[j] < List[j+1]
            Temp <- List[j]
            List[j] <- List[j+1]
            List[j+1] <- Temp
        ENDIF
    NEXT j
NEXT i
